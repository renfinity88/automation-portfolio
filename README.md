# Automation Testing Portfolio

Welcome to my **Automation Testing Portfolio** 
This repository showcases various end-to-end automated testing projects that Iâ€™ve built using **Python, Pytest, Playwright, and API testing tools**.  

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate my ability to:
- Design and automate **realistic business scenarios** (UI & API).
- Cover both **positive and negative test cases**.
- Generate **professional reports** for stakeholders.
- Integrate with **CI/CD pipelines** (GitHub Actions).
- Apply **Page Object Model (POM)** for scalability.
